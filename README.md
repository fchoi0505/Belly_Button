# Belly_Button
Webpage dashboard created to visualize the bacteria data for each volunteer.  Each volunteer are able to identify, based on their volunteer ID, the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.  If Improbably Beef identifies a bacteria species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, each volunteer will be able to identify whether the species is found in their navel.  A horizontal bar chart, a Bubble Chart, and a Gauge Chart are displayed on the webpage that volunteers can interact with by selecting their ID from the dropdown menu.

Customizations have been added to the webpage:  1) Background image for the jumbotron, 2) Background color has been added to the webpage, 3) Font customized for the jumbotron to align with the image added.
